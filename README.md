The Blues jumped out to an early lead but struggled to keep pace with the relentless attacking flow controlled by the likes of Fihaki, Williams and Havili.
Historical settler and rivalry:
The Crusaders and Blues have gone head to head 42 times since the inception of Super Rugby. The Crusaders have recorded 32 wins, the Blues 12, and one game was drawn. The Crusaders have a phenomenal record, especially in their last 18 games, where they have 17 wins.
The rivalry has been defined by gritty contests, memorable playoffs, and a legacy of “bad blood” nestled with a thread of mutual respect. Significantly, Crusaders won their 11th Super Rugby title against the Blues in the final of Eden Park in 2022. That snapped a lengthy winning streak for the Blues.
Key figures in those meetings are Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo'unga, whose head-to-head duels are eagerly awaited and have a substantial bearing on the matches’ outcomes.
2025 Team Performance and Stats:
There have been more runs scored recently by the Crusaders too (1048 — 982) as well as more clean breaks (66 v 41) and defenders beat (215 — 162) and tackles).
The coaching group, headed by Rob Penney, has done a great job to keep their side quietly performing well with discipline each week, as they chase success.
In short:
In 2025 the Crusaders have definitely been the superior side in every encounter with the Blues, comfortably winning all of their recent encounters. Because Super Rugby Pacific is a pressure cooker of competition, the games have been physically demanding, strategically complex and emotionally intense. To be sure, the Crusaders have won more games in the past, and more recently, but the Blues remains a formidable foe that can threaten that run
